# Vein Infared Detector
This project's purpose is to be able to detect veins using a camera with a infared lens to see infared light that is shined onto the surface. The image then goes to the computer which is where you can see your veins.

# Final Milestone
In my final milestone I constructed a cardboard frame that hides the raspberry pi and battery and raises the Infrared LEDs 3 inches above the camera. We figured out from testing that it works better farther away from the camera. I also installed a switch to turn off the circuit just in case the resistors are getting too hot.

# Second Milestone
My second miledstone was creating a new parallel cicuit with double the amount of resistors and LEDs, copying a histogram equalization and video program, and several other things discovered during testing. We also found out that the rechargable battery pack doesn't output enough power (5V) for 8 33 ohm resistors and 8 IR LEDs so I ended up using 4 AA batteries with no step down module

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi, creating a parallel circuit for the LEDs, extracting out the camera from the shell, and testing components. I soon found out that 3 of the step down modules I was given actually step up the power inputted and had to go look for a step down module that worked.

# Starter Project

I chose the useless machine as my starter project because I saw several videos of Lego useless machines. I always found them cool and annoying and wanted to build one when I was younger. The useless machine is a machine that will turn itself off by summoning a leg, hitting the switch and turning it off when the switch is hit by the person. When the switch is hit the motor activates as well as the light to green, turning the switch back off and hitting a button on the motor. This button will then change the direction the leg is moving and changes the light to turn red.
