# Vein Infared Detector
This project's purpose is to be able to detect veins using a camera with a infared lens to see infared light that is shined onto the surface. The image then goes to the computer which is where you can see your veins.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi, creating a parallel circuit for the LEDs, extracting out the camera from the shell, and testing components.

# Starter Project

I chose the useless machine as my starter project because I saw several videos of Lego useless machines. I always found them cool and annoying and wanted to build one when I was younger. The useless machine is a machine that will turn itself off by summoning a leg, hitting the switch and turning it off when the switch is hit by the person. When the switch is hit the motor activates as well as the light to green, turning the switch back off and hitting a button on the motor. This button will then change the direction the leg is moving and changes the light to turn red.
